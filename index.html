            Historically, disadvantaged communities in India have faced significant barriers to accessing education. This exclusion continues to be a pressing issue, particularly in higher education. disadvantaged communities are underrepresented in elite institutions, and systemic barriers hinder their ability to earn degrees. Despite decades of this status quo, systemic change seems elusive. Research demonstrates the positive impact of mentoring on mentees' outcomes and their engagement in their communities. Mentoring is especially crucial for youth from disadvantaged backgrounds, providing hope, role models, guidance, and support that formal education often lacks. The Bahujan Scholars group, started on WhatsApp, aims to connect Bahujan Scholars from outside India. This rapidly growing group, with 86 members, includes graduate students, faculty, and scholars. Its purpose is to foster mentoring, support Bahujan scholars, and organize online events.

                <p>In the Indian context, disadvantaged communities can be defined as social groups who have been historically excluded from educational and economic rights and opportunities and are still being excluded in explicit and implicit forms. Bahujan Scholars endorses a spirit of social justice; therefore, the term disadvantaged community can be interpreted with an inclusive approach.
